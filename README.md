<h1>Hi There, I'm POUQUEROU Baptiste <img  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"></h1>
<h2> About me </h2>
As a student in computer programming at Holberton School <img src="https://github.com/ghinzuka/ghinzuka/assets/102736316/f6acd5ec-bbdf-4f68-9dc3-cb3a50a0e2ef" width="50px">, I have developed a strong foundation in languages such as C and Python during my first year. I have also been introduced to MySQL and tools like SQLAlchemy and Flask for building applications. Currently, I am specializing in Machine Learning, an exciting field that combines my programming skills with data analysis and advanced algorithms.

One of my notable projects was developing a simple printf function in C. This project deepened my understanding of low-level programming and system calls, enhancing my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

### Myshell

I have coded a simple shell called "myshell." It is a basic command-line interface that allows users to execute system commands directly, similar to how a typical Unix shell works. The shell can parse user inputs, manage background and foreground processes, and handle built-in commands like cd and exit. Its functionality includes basic error handling and command execution, providing a minimalistic environment for interacting with the operating system.

### Hbnb

I have developed Hbnb, a clone of Airbnb, using a RESTful API, Docker, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to list, browse, and book rental properties. The back-end is built as a RESTful API to manage CRUD operations for users, properties, and bookings, enabling smooth communication between the client and server. Docker is used to containerize the application, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistent performance across different environments. The front-end, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a user-friendly interface, closely resembling Airbnbâ€™s core functionalities while making it easily accessible and visually appealing.
